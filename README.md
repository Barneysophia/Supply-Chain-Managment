### Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive supply chain management solution using Power BI. By leveraging real-world data, the dashboard provides actionable insights into inventory management, sales performance, and logistics optimization, enabling data-driven decision-making across the entire supply chain, improving operational efficiency and driving informed business strategies.

### Dataset:
The dataset is sourced from a Fashion and Beauty startup, focusing on the supply chain of makeup products. It includes various features related to product performance, customer behavior, and logistics, such as product type, Stock Keeping Unit(SKU), price, availability, price, availability, number of products sold, revenue generated, transportation modes, routes, and associated costs, providing a comprehensive overview of the supply chain operations for analysis and optimization.

### Key Insights:
1. Mumbai and Kolkata contribute the highest revenue generation (24% each), followed by Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi.
2. Skincare accounts for the highest revenue and cost proportion, followed by haircare and cosmetics. It has the highest availability and sales, highlighting a strong demand and supply chain efficiency in this category.
3. Rail, air, and road modes contribute significantly to revenue, accounting for 29%, 28%, and 27% respectively, while sea modes contribute less.
4. Carrier B incurs the highest shipping costs, especially in air and rail transportation modes.
5. Skincare has the highest manufacturing cost but lower lead time, whereas cosmetics have lower costs and shorter lead times.
6. Supplier 1 and Supplier 5 generate the highest revenue with moderate manufacturing costs, showcasing strong cost efficiency.
7. Route C demonstrates the lowest shipping costs and lead time, but order quantities are relatively low compared to Routes A and B.
8. Skincare products have the highest revenue but are associated with higher defect rates, requiring quality improvement measures.
9. Despite lower costs, cosmetics generate less revenue than skincare and haircare, suggesting room for marketing and demand enhancement.

### Recommendations:
1. Invest in marketing and operations in Mumbai and Kolkata to maintain and expand market share.
2. Reevaluate Carrier B's shipping strategies, focusing on air and rail transport, to cut down costs.
3. With high demand and revenue, increasing production while addressing defect rates could maximize profitability.
4. Implement targeted campaigns to boost the demand and revenue for cosmetics.
5. Address the defect rate in skincare products to prevent revenue loss and maintain customer trust.
6. Maximize the use of Route C for cost-efficient and faster deliveries, especially for low-demand regions.
7. Streamline processes to reduce lead time, especially for high-demand categories like haircare.
8. Continuously track and optimize stock levels to ensure availability aligns with demand.

### Conclusion:
The Power BI dashboard provides a clear picture of the supply chainâ€™s current performance, highlighting areas for improvement. Key findings such as high revenue generation in specific regions and product categories, along with opportunities to reduce shipping costs and improve product quality, offer actionable insights. By addressing these areas through better marketing, cost optimization, and operational streamlining the company can enhance supply chain efficiency, improve profitability, and strengthen its competitive position in the market.
